# CoHDL documentation

This repository contains an introduction for the [CoHDL](https://github.com/alexander-forster/cohdl) hardware description language built in Python.

The notebooks in `cohdl_introduction/with_output` contain the execution results (mostly the generated VHDL code) but are otherwise identical to the versions in `cohdl_introduction`.
